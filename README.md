# BigBenBox

This was an attempt to make a privately hosted file storage, similar to Dropbox.  
It's not finished, and never will be. I'm hosting it here only for demonstration purposes.

The idea was to build a native application, able to handle filesystem events and synchronize files via a server.  
Synchronization is chunk-based, so that the whole process is optimal in terms of speed and storage space.
